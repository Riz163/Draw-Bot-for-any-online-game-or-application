# Draw-Bot-for-any-online-game-or-application
works on anything with a canvas, a constant brush size and and colors

for eg:
* skribbl.io
* gartic phone, gartic.io
* sketchful.io
* ms paint

features:
* outline drawing like a human (kinda)
* outline drawing with lines
* colored dithering
* black and white dithering
* quantized drawing for faster times (color by color or line by line)
* settings for colors, brushsize, speed and drawing area
* uses image URL
\
* keyboard mode - run the file and hit f9 to enter and exit keyboard mode, for now only A ... Z and whitespace are supported

run it by simply double clicking the Nuspli file and on first run it should install all the requirements on its own\
a few cmd windows will pop up, just give it some time to install everything. (make sure to upgrade pip if it stays in a loop)\
make sure to calibrate it before drawing by pressing Calibrate\
if any emergencies occour, press "q" to trigger the failsafe

I belive this is the fastest and most versitile one out there and it's also very easy to use

I also recommend using clipart images for faster drawing times (not necessary for dithering)
