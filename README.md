# Draw-Bot-for-any-online-game-or-application
works on anything with a canvas, a constant brush size and and colors

for eg:
* skribbl.io
* gartic phone, gartic.io
* sketchful.io
* ms paint

features:
* outline drawing like a human (kinda)
* outline drawing with lines
* colored dithering
* black and white dithering
* quantized drawing for faster times (color by color or line by line)
* settings for colors, brushsize, speed and drawing area
* uses image URL

* keyboard mode - run the file and hit f9 to enter and exit keyboard mode, for now only A ... Z and whitespace are supported

before running, install the requirements using pip\
make sure to calibrate it before drawing by pressing Calibrate\
if any emergencies occour, press "q" to trigger the failsafe

I belive this is the fastest and most versitile one out there and it's also very easy to use

I also recommend using clipart images for faster drawing times (not necessary for dithering)
